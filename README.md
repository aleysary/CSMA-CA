# CSMA-CA

A Java-based simulation of the CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance) protocol, demonstrating RTS/CTS/ACK communication, collision avoidance, and dynamic node interaction.

Features
Implements RTS/CTS/ACK messaging with accurate SIFS/DIFS delays.
Handles channel contention using Binary Exponential Backoff (BEB).
Visualizes communication timelines with a graphical interface.
